This site contains the lab exercises that are part of my presentation entitled:

"[Node.js - An Introduction](http://slides.com/rkiel/node-js-intro#/)"

The exercises were developed using node.js installed on Ubuntu via Vagrant.
It is not a requirement that you use Vagrant but I've found Vagrant to be a great development tool.
There is short lab to help you with [installing Vagrant](https://github.com/rkiel/node-intro/wiki/Lab-:-Installing-Vagrant).
