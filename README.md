### Node.js -- An Introduction

I recently did a tech talk presentation for my company on Node.js.

The slides are available for "[Node.js - An Introduction](http://slides.com/rkiel/node-js-intro#/)".
The agenda for the presentation has two parts.:

Overview
* Why Node.js?
* What is Node.js?
* How do I run Node.js?

Details - covers 3 key areas with lots of code examples
* Modules
* Events
* Packaged Modules

At the end of four of the sections, I include a hands-on, step-by-step lab exercise.
The exercises were developed using Node.js installed on Ubuntu via Vagrant.
It is not a requirement that you use Vagrant but I've found it to be a great development tool.
