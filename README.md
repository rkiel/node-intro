This site contains the lab exercises that are part of my
presentation entitled "[Node.js - An Introduction](http://slides.com/rkiel/node-js-intro#/)"

The exercises were developed using node.js installed on Vagrant.
It is not a requirement that you use Vagrant but convenience.
There is short lab to help you with [installing Vagrant](https://github.com/rkiel/node-intro/wiki/Lab-:-Installing-Vagrant).
